# Bezier Curve and Hodograph Visualization  

## Overview  
This project provides an interactive visualization of **Bezier curve** and its **hodographs** (velocity diagram). Users can dynamically add, move, and remove control points to see real-time updates of both the Bezier curve and its hodograph.  

## Features  
- **Interactive control points**: Add, move, and delete points.  
- **Real-time updates**: The Bezier curve and its hodograph update instantly.  
- **Hodograph visualization**: Displays the derivative of the Bezier curve, representing velocity.  
- **Clean UI**: Two-panel layout for curve and hodograph visualization.  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Rendering the Bezier curve and hodograph.  
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Handles user interactions and calculations.  
- **CSS**: Provides styling for the interface.  

## How to Use  
1. **Add control points**: Click on the left panel to place a point.  
2. **Move points**: Drag existing points to modify the curve.  
3. **Delete points**: Right-click on the left panel to remove the last added point.  
4. **Observe the hodograph**: The right panel shows the velocity diagram of the curve.
